# InfoSec - Encryption and Decryption Application
This Java code provides a simple command-line application for performing encryption, decryption, and digital signature operations using the RSA encryption algorithm. It demonstrates how to create a key pair, encrypt text, decrypt the encrypted text, and sign the encrypted data. This code can be used as a learning resource or as a starting point for building more robust security applications.
